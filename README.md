Server for the application [GameSaveSyncClient](https://github.com/voxors/GameSaveSyncClient).

## Objective

The goal is to have a centralized backup solution for game saves that can sync between
multiple client and deal with conflict

## Data

The database is a SQLite file located at `./data/database.sqlite`.
All save files are stored under `./data/saves`, and temporary uploads are placed in `./data/tmp`.

---

## API Endpoints

The full OpenAPI spec is auto‑generated by Utoipa and can be viewed at `/swagger-ui`.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust edition 2024
- Cargo
- SQLite (bundled, no extra install needed)
- (Optional) Docker

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/GameSaveSyncServer.git
cd GameSaveSyncServer

# Build and run
cargo run
```

The server will start on `0.0.0.0:3000`.
Create the initial database and folders automatically on first run.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t gamesavesyncserver .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data gamesavesyncserver
```

---

## Authentication
The server uses a bearer token for all authenticated requests.  
When the server starts for the first time, it generates a random token, stores it in the database, and prints it to stdout.  
Clients should save this token and include it in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all API calls.

## Development
- **Migrations** – Add new migrations in `migrations/` and run `diesel migration run`.
- **Testing** – Unit tests are in `tests/` (not yet added). Run with `cargo test`.
- **Formatting** – `cargo fmt`.
- **Linting** – `cargo clippy`.
